A proof of concept resume builder.
----------------------------------

This project was an opportunity to play and learn with Angular.js.
The builder recompiles the serialized resume document data in on model change.
Elements can be modified, added, sorted and deleted. Limited style attributes can also be modified via a pop-in box.
This project was built and tested using chrome. Other browsers will experience limited functionality.
